## PhD_machine-learning-script
Script created with the purpose of developing a predictive algorithm capable of classifying Hepatocelullar Carcinoma in Patientes infected with Hepatitis C Virus

Part of the data used steamed from previous researches supervised by Dr Luydson Vasconcelos and Dr Patricia Moura. 

The crew responsible for treating the data and developing the algorithm based on Machine Learning models were the **co-supervisor Dr Joao Pacifico** and PhD **student Joao Victor Farias**. The main project was done under **supervision of Dr Patricia Moura and co-supervised by Dr Luydson Vasconcelos**. 

This data was used in the PhD thesis titled _"Machine Learning techniques for prediction of risk to develop hepatocellular carcinoma in patients infected with the hepatitis C virus"_. The PhD student was enrolled at the PhD program _Celullar and Molecular Biology_ at the **University of Pernambuco**.
